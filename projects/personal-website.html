                        First, Some Context
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Ever since I got into web development I thought it would be awesome to have a website of my very
                        own. And as my skills have improved and I've started to enter the workforce, building a cool
                        website seemed like it would be a good self-marketing tool too!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I actually made an attempt at making my own website way back in 2016/2017 and host it myself on
                        a server put together from spare PC parts lying around my basement. At this point I didn't have
                        the skills or drive I have now, so it never got past a single raw, unstyled html page. It didn't
                        even stay up that long, since this was also my first attempt at building and running a server,
                        as well as hosting a web server. The server kept shutting down for unknown reasons (probably
                        power flickers) and eventually I moved on to other projects and the server stayed dead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what you're looking at right now is attempt number two! I started revisiting the idea of a
                        personal website in late 2018 and early 2019, and this time I had an additional two years of
                        schooling and a lot more web development experience to leverage. The website is very much still
                        under development, but I'm already happy with how far I've come with it, and I'm looking forward
                        to continuing to work on it!

                        I know, I know, I can already hear you say
                        <i
                            >"but we have all these modern web frameworks, why the heck would you go back to early 2000s
                            web development?!?!"</i
                        >
                        I'm not crazy, I swear! I actually decided to do this because I had never previously developed a
                        full website without using a framework of some kind, and I wanted to learn more about the base
                        technologies that all these modern frameworks are built upon and what sort of limitations
                        inspired them. That, and I wanted to keep this website as simple as possible, since I want it to
                        be a showcase for my projects and a place for interested people to learn more about me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other cool technical stuff about this project:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This webiste is hosted on an NGINX server running behind an NGINX reverse proxy, all running
                            on my home server.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I've got continuous integration set up for this through my Jenkins server, so every time I
                            commit to the master branch of the repo the website is built and deployed to the server! It
                            was super fun to set up, and now it saves me a ton of time when making changes! Like the
                            change that adds this page to the website, come to think of it...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You might have noticed that there are no backend technologies in that list, and you would be
                            right! Because of how simple I'm keeping it, the website itself doesn't have any backend
                            functionality to worry about, so everything is baked into the HTML and JavaScript. This has
                            it's pros and cons for sure, but it keeps things simple and has been an interesting design
                            challenge to work with.
