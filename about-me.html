                </h3>
                <p>
                    That's me! I love all things technical, be that coding or otherwise. Want to chat about how combustion
                    engines work? Or how beer, wine, and cider are made? Or maybe civil engineering is more your thing
                    and we can chat about dam construction and engineered soils. Software is my main focus, but even
                    within that range I like to learn a bit of everything. I've done front-end, back-end, and full-stack
                    development, IT support, system administration, and even a little bit of embedded systems programming!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a firm believer in life-long learning, and I bring that attitude with me wherever I go. There's
                    always something new to learn, and I love that! I don't claim to be an expert in anything, because 
                    (as much of a cliche as it may be) one thing I've learned is the dizzying depth of what I still have
                    left to learn.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    tl;dr: I'm a huge nerd that loves to learn how stuff works.

                    Here's the short summary of me, but if you want to see details on my experience keep scrolling past
                    this section.

                    <li>
                        <b class="text-success">I'm a generalist.</b> I know enough to be able to work with a lot of 
                        different technologies, so I can hit the ground running in most environments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b class="text-success">I love to learn.</b> I'm that person that loves to dive into the gritty
                        details of the tech they're working with, and if you drop me in a new setting it won't be long
                        before I dive right in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b class="text-success">I'm a chill dude.</b> I have a pretty easy time getting along with 
                        pretty much everyone I've ever met, even when we have nothing in common. I'm also easy going
                        about most things, which is really helpful until we need to decide on what restaurant to go to!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b class="text-success">I always plan for the future.</b> That means I'm always keeping in mind
                        what effect the decisions I make now might have later. Often that means making changes in a way 
                        that makes later modifications easier or automating simple tasks.
