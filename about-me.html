                </h3>
                <p>
                    That's me! I love all things technical, be that coding or otherwise. Want to chat about how combustion
                    engines work? Or how beer, wine, and cider are made? Or maybe civil engineering is more your thing
                    and we can chat about dam construction and engineered soils. Software is my main focus, but even
                    within that range I like to learn a bit of everything. I've done front-end, back-end, and full-stack
                    development, IT support, system administration, and even a little bit of embedded systems programming!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a firm believer in life-long learning, and I bring that attitude with me wherever I go. There's
                    always something new to learn, and I love that! I don't claim to be an expert in anything, because 
                    (as much of a cliche as it may be) one thing I've learned is the dizzying depth of what I still have
                    left to learn.

                                    I graduated with distinction from the Software Engineering program at Western University in
                                    June of 2019 after completing my four years of study, plus a one-year work placement.

                                    While at Western I had the opportunity to learn how to manage my time in a crunch, work in a
                                    team, and manage large projects. Events like Hack Western and the Western Engineering
                                    Competition (WEC) were particularly helpful (and fun!), especially when it came to learning
                                    time management and teamwork since we had to work in a small team to complete our designs
                                    within a relatively short time frame. Clubs like WE Bots and WEGA were great for practicing
                                    teamwork and leadership skills; I even helped start up the recurring WE Bots Battle Bots
                                    event! Big projects like my <a href="https://github.com/sarwhelan/cubesat-mission-ops"

                                    At DAC I worked in an agile environment doing web development for several products and internal tools. I was able to improve and broaden my skills to include working with MongoDB, SQL, and ASP.NET, as well as gain some valuable experience working in a professional agile environment for the first time.

                                    During my time as an Undergraduate Student Research Assistant at Western, I worked under Dr. McIsaac to develop a new web-based teaching tool for simulating microcontrollers. This project was fascinating to me, as I got to learn more about the inner workings of microcontrollers while improving my knowledge of TypeScript and web development. With a strong emphasis on clean code and unit testing, I also learned a lot about how to keep my code easy to read and maintain, and how to unit test thoroughly.

                                    was migrating documents to a new file generation system, which required a deep understanding
                                    of the inner workings of both the new and old file generation systems, as well as the SQL
                                    databases that the documents were built from. In addition, some smaller tasks I worked on
                                    included patching SQL injection vulnerabilities and improving user experience in one of
                                    FCT's many products. To my knowledge, most of my work is currently being used in production
                                    environments at FCT.
