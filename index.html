                    game filtering options.

                            At DAC I worked in an agile environment doing web development for several products and internal tools. I was able to improve and broaden my skills to include working with MongoDB, SQL, and ASP.NET, as well as gain some valuable experience working in a professional agile environment for the first time.

                            During my time as an Undergraduate Student Research Assistant at Western, I worked under Dr. McIsaac to develop a new web-based teaching tool for simulating microcontrollers. This project was fascinating to me, as I got to learn more about the inner workings of microcontrollers while improving my knowledge of TypeScript and web development. With a strong emphasis on clean code and unit testing, I also learned a lot about how to keep my code easy to read and maintain, and how to unit test thoroughly.

                            As a Co-op Programmer at FCT, I worked extensively with Microsoft SQL databases, C# and
                            Visual Basic applications, and Cold Fusion web pages. During my co-op term my main project
                            was migrating documents to a new file generation system, which required a deep understanding
                            of the inner workings of both the new and old file generation systems, as well as the SQL
                            databases that the documents were built from. In addition, some smaller tasks I worked on
                            included patching SQL injection vulnerabilities and improving user experience in one of
                            FCT's many products. To my knowledge, most of my work is currently being used in production
                            environments at FCT.

                            While at Western I had the opportunity to learn how to manage my time in a crunch, work in a
                            team, and manage large projects. Events like Hack Western and the Western Engineering
                            Competition (WEC) were particularly helpful (and fun!), especially when it came to learning
                            time management and teamwork since we had to work in a small team to complete our designs
                            within a relatively short time frame. Clubs like WE Bots and WEGA were great for practicing
                            teamwork and leadership skills; I even helped start up the recurring WE Bots Battle Bots
                            event! Big projects like my <a href="https://github.com/sarwhelan/cubesat-mission-ops"
                                target="_blank">fourth year capstone project</a> were perfect opportunities to hone my
                            project management and development skills.
