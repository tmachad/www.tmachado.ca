                    game filtering options.

                            As a Cyber Security Analyst Co-op, I worked to manage and monitor the security
                            infrastructure used at CTC. In my time at CTC I developed several web-based monitoring
                            dashboards used by the cybersecurity team to monitor the security of the corporation, as
                            well as DevOps version control tools for managing service configurations in an easily
                            tracked way. I really enjoyed by time at CTC, and it was a great opportunity to learn about
                            enterprise security systems, system management, and system monitoring.

                            I really enjoyed my time at DAC, and I'm grateful for all of the things it taught me.

                            During my time as an Undergraduate Student Research Assistant at Western, I worked under Dr.
                            McIsaac to develop a new teaching tool for teaching the inner workings of microcontrollers.
                            Using TypeScript, I helped build and test a comprehensive library of components for
                            building, simulating, and programming arbitrary microcontrollers.

                            As a Co-op Programmer at FCT, I worked extensively with Microsoft SQL databases, C# and
                            Visual Basic applications, and Cold Fusion web pages. During my co-op term my main project
                            was migrating documents to a new file generation system, which required a deep understanding
                            of the inner workings of both the new and old file generation systems, as well as the SQL
                            databases that the documents were built from. In addition, some smaller tasks I worked on
                            included patching SQL injection vulnerabilities and improving user experience in one of
                            FCT's many products. To my knowledge, most of my work is currently being used in production
                            environments at FCT.

                            While at Western I had the opportunity to learn how to manage my time in a crunch, work in a
                            team, and manage large projects. Events like Hack Western and the Western Engineering
                            Competition (WEC) were particularly helpful (and fun!), especially when it came to learning
                            time management and teamwork since we had to work in a small team to complete our designs
                            within a relatively short time frame. Clubs like WE Bots and WEGA were great for practicing
                            teamwork and leadership skills; I even helped start up the recurring WE Bots Battle Bots
                            event! Big projects like my <a href="https://github.com/sarwhelan/cubesat-mission-ops"
                                target="_blank">fourth year capstone project</a> were perfect opportunities to hone my
                            project management and development skills.
